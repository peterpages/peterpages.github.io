<h2>Teaser Movie Clips</h2>

</div><div class="body">

<table width="750"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">If you too can't wait until the Spring 2006 full length trailer release date, hopefully these sneak peeks will tide you over. (Why wait, now that the <a href="film.html">actual film</a> has been released?)

<p>The original teaser trailer is taken straight from the <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i> trailer, modified for the purpose of simply getting the word out about the upcoming production.  The "Driving" teaser shows off the first real product to come out of the filming, set to some appropriate music; in a "proof of concept" of sorts.

<p>The third teaser was produced after the bulk of principal photography was completed.  The Talking Heads song "Don't Worry About the Government" mirrors life in Hillcrest and at Tech in general remarkably well, so it was chosen to show off some of the new shots without completely giving away the form and style of the film.

<p>Essentially, this is a music video for this song, which I'm going to assume that you, being a huge Talking Heads fan already own, so I'm not violating any copyright regulations... just saving you the trouble of synchronizing your own audio.  For this one, just sit back and see what kinds of footage we have so far.  Some of the weirder stuff in this trailer probably won't be in the film by the way, just to keep you from worrying.
