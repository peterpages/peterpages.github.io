<h2>The Actual Film!</h2>

<table width="750"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top"><p>We eventually promised "Spring 2006," and by 7 hours, we made it!</p>

<p>Now, you can see what all the fuss has been about.  We here at PeterPages.net are proud to (finally) present <i>Techaanisqatsi</i>.  Through countless manhours, over 5 hours of video have been transformed into the unexpectedly long 28 minute long "trailer."  It is called a trailer because it is an abridged version of the orignial film <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>, this film can be considered in its final incarnation.  All that is left now is the various special features, as previously advertised and as mentioned during the film's closing credits.  So pick a size below, download the file (or files, in the case of the dial-up version), and enjoy.</p>

<p>To download, right click (hold "ctrl" and click for Mac users) and select something to the effect of "Save Link As..." or "Download Link to Disk".</p><p>Also: Because of Larger/Smaller then intended export sizes, all but the Medium and Large sizes have distorted line breaks in the credits.  Sorry.</p>
