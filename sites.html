You probably heard about this letter a few months ago.  The Iranian Prime Minister sent an 18 page letter to President Bush.  Most people in the media passed it off as some sort of crazy raving rant, but it is actually fairly insightful if you take the time to read the whole thing.

Well, I thought this was cool.  It's interesting to see the new stuff VT is looking at doing to make their website better looking and easier to use, as somebody who is looking at doing the same thing (eg, adding more pictures).  Be sure to look at the <a href="http://www.vt.edu/preview/history.html" target="_blank">VT.edu History</a> section.

Now that Dave Barry has stopped doing a regular column, are you in withdrawl?  Ease your pain by making your own Dave Barry-esque column!

This is a website I check a few times a week.  These are usually relatively humorous photos of somebody doing something unsafe or downright stupid.  Feel free to look through the archives (200 weekly pictures and counting) for some classic laughs.<br> <br>NOTE: This page is (as of 7/9/6) offline due to the <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/0/D50CED66D3FA424B852571A4006772D4?opendocument">soldier idently leak</a> problem thing.<br> <br>NOTE: Now it's back!  - 7/17/6
